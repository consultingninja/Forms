# Forms
React Forms
Three ways to implement forms, App.jsx is the way I recommend.  You can see an example of using refs in App-ref-way.jsx.  A console.log will show you what
values are in the ref.current.  It is essenitally all of the html.  Then there is the way I think sucks and everyone should stay away from.  Can rename
them to try each and play around with them.
