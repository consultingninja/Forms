# Forms
React Forms
Three ways to implement forms, (App.jsx) is the way I recommend.  You can see an example of using refs in (App-ref-way.jsx).  A console.log will show you what values are in the ref.current.  It is essenitally all of the html.  Then there is the way I think sucks and everyone should stay away from and 
that is in (App-old-way.jsx).  You can take turns renaming each one at a time into the App.jsx name to run and see results or just look at the different
ways I show.
